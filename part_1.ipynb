    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our first intro to coding in science lesson! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding in science\n",
    "This is not your usual intro to computer science class. As researchers, it is important for us to know some programming so we can do our work efficiently, but our main focus should not deviate from the actual science. I believe it's best to learn as much coding as is useful to that end, and I have crafted these lessons with this in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, coding is a precise art. Our first lesson may seem unusually, painstakingly meticulous. This is because we must be perfectly exact when communicating with the computer, so it is helpful to have a thorough base before just diving in. This also helps us get in the coding mindset. In parts II and III, we will start getting into practical applications. I promise if you bear with me, stuff will actually get fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "## These lessons\n",
    "As we go through these lessons together, we will skim over a lot of text and focus on practice exercises. The more time you spend writing code, the faster you will feel comfortable coding in your own research. The purpose of the big blocks of descriptive text is to be a useful reference for you later on in your research. Don't worry about getting into the details too much now. Just focus on trying your best, make mistakes, realize your underlying assumptions, and learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "I argue that, when learning to code, it is useful to write incorrect things and generate errors. Many other coding lessons online focus on having you write things that are correct. In the real world of scientific research, a lot of the code you write will cause mysterious errors. By trying to generate errors now, in a learning environment, you learn the bounds of what works and gain experience parsing error messages/fixing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A disclaimer\n",
    "I have a bad habit of anthropomorphizing computers, typically in the context of computers being angry and spitting out scary red error messages. Just to ensure we are all on the same page, computers are not anthropomorphic. They do not get angry. The humans who wrote said error messages are the ones behind any computer-related emotions.\n",

    "## Onward\n",

    "\n",
    "The word \"function\" is typically used as a noun to mean the function of a person or thing. In mathematics, it is \"a variable (such as a quality, trait, or measurement) that depends on and varies with another\" (think `f(x)`). It can also be defined as \"a computer subroutine\". I think it is best for us to think of functions as a combination of the math and computer subroutine definitions. (thank you Merriam-Webster Dictionary)\n",

    "- function name: in this example, we use \"f\". You can name this whatever you want, following the rules of variable names.\n",
    "- arguments: These are the inputs to the function. You can have as many as you want, separated by commas. We use two, x and y.\n",
    "- return statement: This is the last line of a function, and it defines the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of a function definition is always `def your_function_name(your_arguments):`. The \"def\" indicates you are starting a function, then the colon finishes off the starting line. Lines underneath this must be indented by one tab or four spaces. The tab or space choice must be consistent within a single file or you get mysterious errors. Jupyter Lab is kind in that is auto-converts tabs to spaces, so you don't have to worry about that in these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you define a function, you can return to writing code without the tabs, and you can \"call\" your function by writing the name (same as above) with the arguments (now whatever you want). The arguments do not have to match the variable names you chose above, like $x$ and $y$, but they do have to match the positions. There are a few ways you can do this."

In contrast, if outside of the function, we create some variables `a` and `b` and then call the function like `f(a,b)`, now we have created \"global\" variables that exist everywhere in our code, outside of functions or even inside if we want (though this is generally not good practice). \n"

    "# Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with the term \"bug\" to refer to errors or glitches in a program. \"Bug\" has been engineering jargon since the 1870s to describe various hardware defects. A more fun version of the origin of the term originates from Grace Hopper in the 1940s, when a software issue was traced to a moth trapped in a relay and thus causing a malfunction. This bug was carefully removed and taped to the log book. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#cite_note-14)\n",
    "\n",
    "![bug](imgs/First_Computer_Bug_1945.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we refer to the act of removing code errors as \"debugging\". This constitutes a rather large amount of one's time coding. Here are my tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Read the error messages!**\n",
    "\n",
    "I cannot emphasize this enough. When your program fails to run, Python will usually give you some helpful feedback for fixing things. In particular, it should tell you the exact line in your code that is causing the error. This is a great starting place for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Be exact with your syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "Capitalization, punctuation, spacing, tabbing -- all must be perfect for the computer to understand what you mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Be exact with your instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer cannot read between the lines. If you aren't sure why your program is doing what it's doing, try getting in this ultra-precise mindset and re-read what you wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Consider all possibilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you will need to use \"if\" statements to handle outlier cases. Say you write a function to add two numbers; what happens if you input an argument that is not a number? Or what if you try to open a file, but the file does not exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Use print statements at different lines**\n",
    "\n",
    "When code gets complicated, it is easy to lose track of what is equal to what and where.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Stack Exchange is your new best friend**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can't solve an error yourself, copy-pasting error messages into a search engine will often be helpful, since other people have often run into the same errors that you have."
