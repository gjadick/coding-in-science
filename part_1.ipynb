    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of these lessons is to teach simple coding techniques you can apply to your scientific research.\n",
    "In addition to the basics, you will learn to create your own programs, \n",
    "read and write data files, generate simulated data, compare experimental findings to theory,\n",
    "analyze and process images, present results with engaging plots, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons are structured into different parts, which are meant to provide a natural progression\n",
    "from basic coding logic (taught in Python, but applicable to any coding language) to increasingly advanced\n",
    "applications. There will be interactive exercises, which is (in my evidence-backed opinion) the best way to learn anything.\n",
    "By completing these exercises between short lessons, you will also build a useful library of code snippets\n",
    "that you can reference and build upon over the course of your scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of these lessons is inspired by the first few chapters of *Computational Physics* by Mark Newman, which is the textbook I read to learn most of what I know about coding.\n",
    "It is excellently written, and I highly recommend you check it out. Please let me know if you would like to borrow my copy. \n"

    "## What is coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about \"coding\", we refer to the task of writing instructions for a computer to execute.\n",
    "This is likely familiar from your interactions in the regular world, but these instructions will be very different from those you typically give to humans.\n",
    "I think this is best illustrated by the \"exact instruction challenge\", typically for making\n",
    "a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, in which someone is tasked with giving unsparingly *exact* instructions, \n",
    "down to the most minute detail, considering every possibility in the construction of the PB&J.\n",
    "It has been popularized by introductory computer science classes.\n",
    "[Here is a brief example video from Harvard's CS50 lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ).\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you just want the highlights, jump to the 5 minute mark. I think step 18 is when it gets pretty funny).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately (or fortunately?), computers are not nearly as intelligent as humans (yet?), \n",
    "so we require special, simple \"languages\" with\n",
    "rigid logic structures for conveying these detailed instructions. You have likely heard\n",
    "the names of some of these: Python, MATLAB, R, C, C++, among others. These have been designed for a\n",
    "range of various applications by clever people who have a knack for translating human-readable \n",
    "words into 1s and 0s for your computer. This is great news for us. We can focus on writing instructions,\n",
    "while the language translates everything for the computer behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python filetypes (for the detail-oriented)\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be excessively detailed, but I think it is good to explain Python filetypes.\n",
    "As you may already know, the stuff after the \".\" in filenames is called the file extension, and it gives information \n",
    "about what the type of file is. File extensions are handy for telling your computer what program to use when you open a file.\n",
    "When you click a \".docx\", Microsoft Word opens. When you click \".txt\", a plain text editor opens. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Python has its own filetypes. The most basic is the \".py\" file. \n",
    "The actual content of this file is plain text, but the \".py\" in the name tells your computer that \n",
    "it is some kind of code/script to be executed. You can open and edit it in a plain text editor, but you probably need a special program\n",
    "to let you run it (as in, actually do stuff with it). \n",
    "\n",
    "The files we will work with are \".ipynb\"s, or iPython notebooks. Jupyter Lab is my prefered way for interfacing \n",
    "with these files. I have found that Python notebooks are handy for interactively running snippets of code one at a time using separate \"blocks\". You can also intersperse \n",
    "blocks of rich text (\"markdown\"), like this box, which is helpful for adding explanations between parts.\n",
    "You can double-click a markdown box to edit it. You hit the triangle play button at the top, or just \"shift\"-\"enter\" to execute any single block.\n",
    "A typical \".py\" file is different, just a block of Python-syntax text. You can run these from the terminal with `python my_filename.py`. This is useful for other things,\n",
    "and you may find this is better for your research purposes. For our tutorial, we'll use notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For later\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever want to learn more, there are many nice introductions to Python online. The lessons here will be more tailored to things\n",
    "I suspect will be useful as you begin scientific research. The Python Tutorial offers a nice general set of lessons: [link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## To the actual coding lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "This ends my obligatory introduction. Next, on to the fun stuff! \n",
    "\n",
    "This first part here may seem unusually, painstakingly meticulous. This is because of how exact we must be when communicating with the computer, so it is helpful to have a thorough base before just diving in. This also helps us get in the coding mindset. Parts 2 and 3 will be where we start doing practical applications, so I promise if you bear with me, stuff will actually get fun."

In mathematics, it is \"a variable (such as a quality, trait, or measurement) that depends on and varies with another\" (think `f(x)`). It can also be defined as \"a computer subroutine\". I think it is best for us to think of functions as a combination of the math and computer subroutine definitions. (thank you Merriam-Webster Dictionary)\n",

    "- arguments: These are the inputs to the function. You can have as many as you want, separated by commas. We use two, x and y.\n",
    "- return statement: This is the last line of a function, and it defines the output.\n",

    "The first line of a function definition is always `def your_function_name(your_arguments):`. The \"def\" indicates you are starting a function, then the colon finishes off the starting line. Lines underneath this must be indented by one tab or four spaces. The tab or space choice must be consistent within a single file or you get mysterious errors. Jupyter Lab is kind in that is auto-converts tabs to spaces, so you don't have to worry about that in these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you define a function, you can return to writing code without the tabs, and you can \"call\" your function by writing the name (same as above) with the arguments (now whatever you want).

    "# Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with the term \"bug\" to refer to errors or glitches in a program. \"Bug\" has been engineering jargon since the 1870s to describe various hardware defects. A more fun version of the origin of the term originates from Grace Hopper in the 1940s, when a software issue was traced to a moth trapped in a relay and thus causing a malfunction. This bug was carefully removed and taped to the log book. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#cite_note-14)\n",

    "So, we refer to the act of removing code errors as \"debugging\". This constitutes a rather large amount of one's time coding. Here are my tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Read the error messages!**\n",
    "\n",
    "I cannot emphasize this enough. When your program fails to run, Python will usually give you some helpful feedback for fixing things. In particular, it should tell you the exact line in your code that is causing the error. This is a great starting place for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Be exact with your syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "Capitalization, punctuation, spacing, tabbing -- all must be perfect for the computer to understand what you mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Be exact with your instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer cannot read between the lines. If you aren't sure why your program is doing what it's doing, try getting in this ultra-precise mindset and re-read what you wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Consider all possibilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you will need to use \"if\" statements to handle outlier cases. Say you write a function to add two numbers; what happens if you input an argument that is not a number? Or what if you try to open a file, but the file does not exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Use print statements at different lines**\n",
    "\n",
    "When code gets complicated, it is easy to lose track of what is equal to what and where.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Stack Exchange is your new best friend**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can't solve an error yourself, copy-pasting error messages into a search engine will often be helpful, since other people have often run into the same errors that you have."
