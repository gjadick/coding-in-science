    "# NumPy\n",
    "NumPy is a powerful numerical computing package for Python. It comes with its own data classes, most notably the **numpy array**  (or just \"array\" for short), which is similar to a list or list of lists up to \"n\" dimensions (n-d), except it has some stricter requirements and even more useful functions and attributes. A Python **class** is a custom data type you can define to bundle data and functionality together for your unique application. We won't get in the specifics of classes here, but you can read more [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html). For our purposes, we will just use other library classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NumPy arrays\n",
    "NumPy is especially handy for working with multi-dimensional arrays. This is different from the Python list-of-lists in a few key ways:\n",
    "- array elements must all have the **dtype**, or data type\n",
    "- array sublists must all be the same length (think n-dimensional rectangular prism)\n",
    "- array **size** is fixed after creation (you cannot append/pop)\n",
    "- array **shape** can be changed, as long as the size is the same\n",
    "- arrays can act like vectors and matrices for math operations\n",
    "\n",
    "`dtype`, `size`, and `shape` are **attributes** of every NumPy array. `dtype` is the data type of each element, `size` gives you the total number of elements in an array, and `shape` gives you the number of elements along each axis. You can reference them with syntax like a function from a library, but without the parentheses:\n",
    "```\n",
    "arr_element_type = my_array.dtype\n",
    "arr_shape = my_array.shape\n",
    "arr_size = my_array.size\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get working with numpy arrays. There are a number of ways to create, or **initialize** an array:\n",
    "- convert a list to an array with `np.array(my_list)`\n",
    "- read a data file with `np.fromfile(filename)`\n",
    "- call a numpy function like `np.empty(), np.zeros(), np.ones()`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the functions `np.empty(), np.zeros(), np.ones()`, you typically pass one or two arguments:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_array = np.ones(shape, dtype=data_type)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `shape` can be either an integer (to create a vector) or a list of $n$ integers (to create an $n$-d matrix)\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Multi-dimensional indexing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like lists, we can index arrays using brackets and index numbers, starting from 0. \n",
    "For multiple dimensions, there are a few ways we can get sub-elements. For a 2D array `M`, each single-index element `M[i]` will be a 1D array. To get a single number, we need two indices, like `M[i,j]`. As we increase the number of dimensions, this works the same way, recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comma-separated indexing is unique to numpy arrays. Alternatively, you can index both arrays and lists-of-lists using extra brackets, so `M[i][j][k]` is equivalent to `M[i,j,k]`. This is because `M[i]` gives you a list, which you can then index again using brackets. I personally find this method somewhat clunkier and harder to parse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your initialized array, you can change individual elements (single elements or sub-arrays) using indices, e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "matrix = np.ones([2,2])\n",
    "matrix[0,0] = 100.0      # change an element\n",
    "matrix[1] = [5.0, 5.0]   # change a sub-array (size must match!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Reshaping**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have an array, we cannot change its size, but we can change its shape. For the scientist, this is most useful for reading in data. We usually read data into a 1D array, so we can easily use reshape to convert this into a 2D array (this could be a data table or an image). \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that array size is equal to the product of the values in its shape. We can change the array shape to any other shape that fulfills this requirement using `reshape`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "reshaped_array = array.reshape(new_shape)\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example, we could reshape a 3x4 array into a 2x6 array (also 2D) or into a 1x12 (1D, fewer dimensions) or a 2x3x4 (3D, more dimensions). You can also swap dimension order, and reshape a 3x4 into a 4x3.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also remove any multi-dimensionality or `flatten` an array into 1D. This is convenient, because you don't have to pass a \"new_shape\" argument.\n",
    "```\n",
    "flat_array = array.flatten()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Type changing**\n",
    "\n",
    "All the elements of a numpy array must be the same, but you can reassign them using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_type_array = my_array.astype(new_type)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This might be handy if you want to change integers to floats for some math, or if you read in a text file and want to convert your strings to numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Arithmetic**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same math operators we learned in Part I with numpy arrays, either with one numpy array (any shape) and a constant, or with two numpy arrays (must be same size). The latter approach gives an element-wise result. Take a look at the outputs below."
