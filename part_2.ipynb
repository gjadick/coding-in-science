    "\n",
    "Lists are probably the most important variable type to understand when working with scientific data. We use lists to handle parameters, variables, and tables of information to analyze. We often want to re-format file text into some kind of list or list of lists (i.e. a table).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like strings, lists have their own functions and methods that are important for expertly implementing them. Here is a short overview of the ones that are most useful for the scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Length**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **length** of a list, or number of list elements, is found using the `len` function:\n",
    "```\n",
    "num_elements = len(my_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Indexing**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Images from [learnbyexample.org](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python-list-slicing/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "To access a single element from a list, we use **indexing** by placing an integer in brackets after a list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "one_element = full_list[index]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first element has index `0` and the last element has index `len(my_list) - 1`. Starting with 0 might seem weirdly complicated--why not start with 1?--but it actually becomes useful for iterating through the list in \"for\" loops with the \"range\" function. (Not all languages index from 0, with MATLAB being one notable example of indexing from 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "![indexing visual](imgs/basics_indexing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Slicing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to access partial elements of a list, we use **slicing** using integers in brackets after a list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "partial_list = full_list[start:stop:step]\n",
    "```\n",
    "You might notice these arguments \"start\", \"stop\", and \"step\" look similar to those for the \"range\" function. They more or less operate in the same way. Each subsequent colon is optional. Including only `start` gives a single value (indexing), including `start` and `stop` gives a continuous slice, and including all three with gives you a slice of every `skip` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike range, we can also skip values in our slice notation and leave a space blank to indicate using the default value. The default `start` is 0, at the beginning of the list. The default `stop` is len(lst)-1, the end of the list. The default `step` is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be mindful that **slicing is not like a function. We slice using brackets (not parentheses) and colons (not commas).**\n",
    "\n",
    "![slicing visual](imgs/basics_slicing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also index and slice backwards using negative numbers. Notably, the last element has index -1. You can also reverse a list order by using a negative `step` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "![backwards indexing visual](imgs/basics_indexing_negative.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Sorting**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call the `lst.sort()` function to alphabetize (for string elements) or order (for number elements). This function will not work on lists that mix strings and numbers, but we can mix floats and integers. The function returns `None`, but it stores the newly sorted list in the old variable `lst`. Some functions will return things and leave the original variable unchanged, others change the original variable, so it is important to keep track of these differences in functions. You can always look things up if you forget (as I often do).\n",
