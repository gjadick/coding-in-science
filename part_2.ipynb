    "# Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are probably the most important variable type to understand when working with scientific data. We use lists to handle parameters, variables, and tables of information to analyze. We often want to re-format file text into some kind of list or list of lists (i.e. a table).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like strings, lists have their own functions and methods that are important for expertly implementing them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental list principle is probably \"indexing\", or accessing each individual element. The elements of a Python list `lst` are denoted as `lst[0], lst[1], lst[2], ...` until you reach the end of the list. The number of elements in a list can be found as `len(lst)`. Since the first element of a list has index `0`, the final element has index `len(lst)-1`. This might seem weirdly complicated--why not start with 1?--but it actually becomes useful for iterating through the list in \"for\" loops with the \"range\" function. You can also go backwards using negative indices. The last element also has index `-1`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "first_element =         lst[0]\n",
    "last_element =          lst[len(lst)-1]\n",
    "also_the_last_element = lst[-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of indexing uses just one number. We can also use multiple numbers, separated by a colon, to grab part of a list. For example, `lst[0:N]` will be a list of the first $N$ elements of `lst`. (Note that since the first element has index 0, this sublist includes `lst[0]` but omits `lst[N]`). If we want to index from the start of the list or to the end of the list, we can also omit the index entirely and just use the colon.\n",
    "```\n",
    "N = len(lst)//2\n",
    "whole_list = lst[:]\n",
    "first_half = lst[:N]\n",
    "last_half =  lst[N:]\n",
    "middle =     lst[N//2 : N + N//2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Direction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can add a second colon that gives us the direction we move indexing the list. This can help us skip over values, getting every 2nd, 3rd, ... Nth value. We can also go backwards, and flip the direction of the list.\n",
    "```\n",
    "every_other_element = lst[::2]\n",
    "reversed_order      = lst[::-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine indexing, slicing, and direction by placing or omitting values between the colons we want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorting**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call the `lst.sort()` function to alphabetize (for string elements) or order (for number elements). This function will not work on lists that mix strings and numbers, but we can mix floats and ints. The function returns `None`, but it stores the newly sorted list in the old variable `lst`. Some functions will return things and leave the original variable unchanged, others change the original variable, so it is important to keep track of these differences in functions. You can always look things up if you forget (as I often do).\n",
